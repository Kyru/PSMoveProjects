## Overview

Compilation of 4 prototypes developed in Unity for using PSMove outside of its native console.

+ Lightcubes is a game for one or two players in which you have to destroy coloured cubes by slashing them with the corresponding lightsaber colour. 
+ LightcubesVR uses the [Trinus](https://www.trinusvirtualreality.com/) service to play the game in VR using your smartphone and VR glasses.
+ YogaMove is an approach to serious games in which you have to replicate the character stretches.
